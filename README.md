# tree_problem
pieces of code to study a math problem

The problem is the following :
What are the coordinates of the trees (Points) on a field (2d-space) that satisfy the following : "Any tree must have a distance to any other tree as an integer"

Constraints :

	1 - can you do it without any constraints ?
	
	2 - can you do it without having trees aligned (3 or more) ?
	
	3 - can you do it without having concentric trees ?
